  * NOTE: Each Blockchain instance can have one or more file-backed DBs, which
  * will all be managed by storage_ (Storage class) to implement internal
  * features as needed. However, these should not store:
  * (i) any data that the consensus engine (cometbft) already stores and
  * that we have no reason to duplicate, such as blocks (OK to cache in RAM),
  * (ii) State (consistent contract checkpoints/snapshots at some execution
  * height) as those should be serialized/deserialized from/to their own
  * file-backed data structures (we are using the dump-to-fresh-speedb system)
  * (iii) the list of contract types/templates that exist, since that pertains
  * to the binary itself, and should be built statically in RAM on startup (const)
  * (it is OK-ish to store in Storage the range of block heights for which a
  * template is or isn't available, while keeping in mind that these are really
  * consensus parameters, that is, changing these means the protocol is forked).
  * What we are going to store in the node db:
  * - Activation block height for contract templates (if absent, the contract
  * template is not yet enabled) -- this should be directly modifiable by node
  * operators when enabling new contracts (these are soft forks).
  * - Events (we will keep these in the BDK to retain control and speed it up)
  * - Any State metadata we may need (e.g. name of latest state snapshot file
  * that was saved, and the last executed, locally seen, final block height).
