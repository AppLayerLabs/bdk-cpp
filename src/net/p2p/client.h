   * ClientFactory
   * Creates and manages multiple Client Sessions
   * Previously, OrbiterSDK was creating a new std::thread and io_context for each client session.
   * This is not very efficient, as it creates a lot of overhead.
   * The ClientFactory uses a single io_context and multiple threads to handle multiple sessions.
   * Instead of creating a new std::thread for each connection, a new "connection" task is posted to the io_context.
   * Strands within the factory and client are used to ensure thread safety.
   * ClientFactory doesn't necesarily "own" the client session, it only creates them in a shared manner.
   * Registration/Unregistration is responsibility of the Manager.
